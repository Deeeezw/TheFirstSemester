# TheFirstSemester
This is what I've been learned on the first semester of Informatics Engineering Education


For the past 6 months studying at Informatics Engineering at Ganesha University of Education, I've been learned a lot of things I've never learned from my Highschool. I learned about how to assembling a personal computer, Implementing Tri Hita Karana on everyday life, Learner Education, and many more.

Some of the course i take needs me to upload a videos about doing the task I've been told by my lecturer, so here's the link to see my previous task/assignment/project.
